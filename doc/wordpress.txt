This project was put together quickly while waiting for a physics job to finish.  It was an exercise to see how quickly I could make a useful page with my current setup on my website.  Including time to research, write, upload, and test the page it took around 20 minutes.

<h3>Overview</h3>

This page uses a Monte Carlo method to estimate &pi;.  This is a pure method in that it does not rely on knowledge of &pi; to make the estimate, as some methods do.  It throws random numbers in a two dimensional area and counts how many lie within the circle of radius \(1\) compared to a square of side \(2\).

<dt><em>Challenge</em>: This was all about speed.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: I already knew everything I needed to put this page together, so it was simply a matter of how quickly I did it.  I'm quite happy with the end result of 1020 seconds. (Resolved)</dd>
